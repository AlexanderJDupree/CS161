# CS161

Coursework and programs for CS161 at Mt. Hood Community College.

This repository is designed to make all programs and coursework easily accessible across
my multiple machines. My programs and coursework are not to be used in replacement for other 
students work. 

Everyone is more than welcome to look at my code and implement my logic into their programs.
However, it is recommended that students try to figure out solutions for their problems by themselves first.
DO NOT copy and paste my programs and turn it in as your own work.
